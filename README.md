# DATA-512-Final-Project
Final Project for DATA 512, Autumn 2018

This analysis is part of the DATA 512 Human Centered Data Science course final project, more information for the course can be found at: https://wiki.communitydata.cc/Human_Centered_Data_Science_(Fall_2018)

## Abstract

This project uses [College Scorecard Data](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) published by the U.S. Department of Education to understand the landscape of higher education from three different persepectives: availability and accessibility of schools across the United States, racial diversity composition across the States and potential factors of post-school earnings.

## Data

This analysis uses two main datasets:

* [2017 College Scorecard Data](https://ed-public-download.app.cloud.gov/downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-All-Data-Elements.csv): Full dataset on 7175 US higher education institutions in 2016-2017 year, including 7175 rows and 1899 columns

* [2017 Post-school Earnings](https://ed-public-download.app.cloud.gov/downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-Treasury-Elements.csv): Comprehensive earnings data on 7175 US higher education institutions in 2016-2017 year, including 7175 rows and 92 columns

All datasets used for this projects are publicly available and accessible under [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) within the United States. 


## Research Questions

1. What are the states that have higher cost of enrollment? What are the states that have the most four-year degree granting institutions available?

2. How are racial diversity different by regions and types of colleges (public vs. private)?

3. What are the potential factors of higher post-school earnings?


## Conclusions

* There are significant differences in terms of education availability, education accessibility across US states and regions. These differences can limit students' ability to attain higher education and should be addressed through state governments.
* Racial diversity is different between private and public schools and different across different regions. Applicants should be made aware of these diversity difference before applying to schools.
* Cost of attendance is a statistically significant positive indicator of post-school earnings, however, more comprehensive analysis is needed to make the casual claim.
