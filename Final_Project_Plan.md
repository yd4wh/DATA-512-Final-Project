## Introduction

During the Obama administration, one of his [initiative](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/education/higher-education) was to provide more transparency to higher education. The goal of this initiative was to link federal funding to performance after graduation. A by-product of this initiative was the release of previously unavailable information like average family income of students, completion metrics and student earnings data through the U.S. Department of Education of a dataset called [College Scorecard Data](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). In my final project, I will use the College Scorecard datasets to analyze relationships within demographic data, tuition and fees data, admission data and student earnings data.
